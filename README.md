# notes-app-backend
NestJs backend for the notes-app mobile app.
The name is app is yet to be finalized.

# INTRODUCTION:
This is an ongoing project. This project is inspired by Jira, a project management tool used by many corporations. The only difference is that this is focused on individual users and small groups (specailly students who rely on combined efforts to run a household) trying to manage small to medium level projects. Examples include: managing a small event or a party, shared grocerry list of a household or roommates, etc.

# BACK STORY - CONCEPTION OF THE PROJECT:
There is an interesting story behind how I first came up with an idea. This same story will one day become the pitch of this project.

So when I was a student at Boston University, I used to live with 2 roommates. Me and my roommates would maintain a Whatsapp group to keep a track of what is finished in our pantry and fridge so that when any of us goes shopping we would buy it from the grocery store.
If I buy something I would update that I have bought (ex. tomatoes) and other person would see it and would not buy it. But most of the time we ended up shopping for the same item and instea of 2 Lbs of tomatoes we would have 6 Lbs of tomatoes.
Sometimes when we knew that the other person is out for shopping, we would assume that the other person will buy the tomatoes and we would end up having no tomatoes in the at the end of the day.
Confusions like this could be fixed by simply communicating and planning properly. But what happens most of the time is that we go out to buy some ice cream and end up buying broccoli, tomatoes and eggs as well. Sometimes we tell other roommates to not buy tomatoes because we are going to buy them but end up forgetting.

How about an app where we just click a button that we are buying tomatoes or have alreay bought tomatoes and other people are notified about it. Not only it will save other person's time who is just going 5 miles to buy some tomatoes but it will also prevent a person from buying additional tomatoes who has already put tomatoes in his cart.
How about we notify other person "I am going to but tomato on my way back from office/school" so the other person who is already in the grocery store can then reply "I am already on it. don't waste your time".

This could otherwise be only save time but also help manage tasks in a much efficient way.

Conside another scenario. I am planning an event at my home and have created a team of 10 people to manage and do the prepatrations.
I can create a small project and create tasks and assign duties to everyone and see the progress such as - have the invitations been distributed, do we have all the raw materials needed to prepare the dishes, have the lighting work been completed, is the pool reay yet, how much percentage of decoration work is completed, etc.
